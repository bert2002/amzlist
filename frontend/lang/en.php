In the <b>second</b> step you need to select a Amazon store in which you want to search the product and a currency. We will do some calculation for your convenience. At the last and <b>third</b> step you need to select the appropriate product. Voil&#224;! Now you can order the product with the best <b>price</b>.<br>In some cases you can <b>link</b> a product to another. When you do this you are creating a connection between two products across the stores. Afterwards it is even easier to compare the products.";
